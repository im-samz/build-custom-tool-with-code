>**Note** it is a best practice to create Virtual Environments before doing the `pip install` to avoid dependency issues/collisions, or if you are running in CodeSpaces.  See [Python Environments in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_creating-environments) for more information.
